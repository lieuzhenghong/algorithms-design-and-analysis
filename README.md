These are my solutions for the course taught by Tim Roughgarden, available at
[Stanford
Lagunita](https://lagunita.stanford.edu/courses/course-v1:Engineering+Algorithms1+SelfPaced/about),
and also available on
[Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/algorithms) as a 4-course
specialisation.

I got the test cases from [Beau Dobbin's repository](https://github.com/beaunus/stanford-algs).
